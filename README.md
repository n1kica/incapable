# Incapable Mod – Overview

This mod revamps a core mechanic: **you can’t break blocks without the correct tool.**

- **Tool Enforcement:** Axes for logs, pickaxes for stone and ores—hands don’t work.
- **Configurable Damage:** Trying without a tool deals minor damage, adjustable in the config.
- **Seamless Integration:** No extra setup required.

More features will come in future updates.
