Incapable Mod

This mod revamps one core aspect: you can’t break blocks without the correct tool.

Tool Requirement: Logs need axes, stone/ores need pickaxes, etc. Bare hands don’t work.

Configurable Damage: Trying without a tool causes minor damage—you can change the damage amount in the config.

Works Out of the Box: No extra setup needed.

Future updates will build on this system. Enjoy the added challenge.
