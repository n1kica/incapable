# INCAPABLE MOD

Revamps block-breaking mechanic by enforcing proper tool use.

## MECHANIC
Blocks like logs, stone, and ores require the correct tool. Soft materials (grass, sand, dirt, etc.) can still be broken by hand.

## DAMAGE
Attempting to break restricted blocks without a tool inflicts minor, configurable damage.

## INTEGRATION
Works out of the box with no extra setup.

## FUTURE
Planned expansions will build on this system.
